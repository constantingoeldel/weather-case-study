# Case Study Weather by Constantin Goeldel

This project is my result for the weather-website case study. Its aim is to convert as many users as possible to sign up for a weather service. A live version can be found [here](https://weather-rho-seven.vercel.app/)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
